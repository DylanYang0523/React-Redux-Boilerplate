# react-redux-boilerplate
React + Redux + Docker + Webpack-Dev-Server + Eslint(Airbnb)

### Philosophy

Hope all new bees in the ReactJs field can reduce their time on searching the target files and create a maintainable project structure.


### Getting Started

Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) on your machine to start your project.

After you started the Docker, run the docker instruction to start the project.

    $ docker-compose up -d

If you want to modify **package.json**, access your docker container's bash mode to execute.

    $ docker exec -it yourContainerId bash
    $ yarn yarnInstructions

You are now ready to go, your applcation should be live at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
